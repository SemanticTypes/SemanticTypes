	<h2>Entity</h2>

	<p>
		Entity is the most basic form to work with and it's defined by the <i>relationships</i>
		it supports, and can be constructed by executing <i>actions</i>
		supported by the entity.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>actions</i> become available as a result of enhancing the
		entity by way of adding a <i>relationship</i> to it. The <i>actions</i>
		can be listed by calling <i>listActions</i> on the entity.
	</p>
	<p>
		The core, out of the box <b>x10d</b> entity is built by bootstrapping
		a <u>special</u> <i>relationship</i> (<b>isRelatedThrough</b>) which
		adds <i>relationships</i> support through three <i>actions</i>: "<b>[add,
			remove, list]Relation</b>".
	</p>
</div>
<div class="x10d_help_introNote">
	<p>Note that each relation being added can add any number of
		actions. An action can be added by multiple relations, in which case
		executing the action will be dispatched to all interested relations.
		??? Some relations are hierarchical, some not.</p>

	<h2>Relationships</h2>
	<p>
		<i>Relationships</i> are mainly used to organize the way entities
		connect to each other and they achieve that by defining a list of
		references to other entities.
	</p>
	<p>The "has" relation for example - is responsible for defining and
		managing the structure and content of an entity. It does so by
		referring to its components (commonly referred as fields) as part of a
		list of entity references. It is important to note that the reference
		is to an entity, which is a first class citizen, public entity in the
		system, not a private detail of a "parent" of sorts.</p>
	<p>
		Out of the box, in addition to the <b>isRelatedThrough</b> special
		relationship that provides the core relationship support(the special
		aspect of the <b>isRelatedThrough</b> is due to its self referring
		nature, requiring it to be bootstrapped), there are 4 hierarchical
		relations provided for entity:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>isA</li>
		<li>canBeA</li>
		<li>has</li>
		<li>isHadBy</li>
	</ul>
	<p>canBeA and isHadBy provide back references for the other 2.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Entities are not persistent, cannot be updated once they're
		saved(they're sealed). Other higher forms are. This is to simplify the
		work required to maintain the updates from the inherited entities
		point of view. However other higher level forms(document) will support
		edits/updates, through the use of versioning, among other things.</p>

	<p>The "isA" relation is responsible for managing inheritance. Keep
		in mind that this is done for the purpose of interactive building of
		entities so the creation of an entity is a multistep process(new,
		edit, save,..).
