                            <p class="p-style">This is an experimental project seeking to understand, 
                            and then - if possible - simplify some of the ways the user interacts with, 
                            describes and organizes information in a digital/programmable system.</p>

                            <p class="p-style">At its core, the goal of this exercise is to:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>observe a class of interactions that drive the information in a system,</li>

                                <li>taking it all apart and then</li>

                                <li>put it back together with a new understanding of what makes it tick (and stick).
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="p-style">In doing so I'm not looking to find any definitive solutions but rather interesting perspectives, and hope that eventually that extra bit of insight will help me improve the way I approach writing code.</p>

                            <p class="p-style">So what exactly are we looking at ?</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="ui dividing header">Information, programs, programmers<a class="anchor" id=
            "ipp"></a></h2>

                        <div class="no example">
                            <h4 class="ui header">The information</h4>
                            <a class="anchor" id="info"></a>

                            <div class="ui container justified" style="padding: 1em;">
                                <p class="p-style">The way information transforms while flowing through a system can be quite complex and over the course of time many words have been said in the quest to find the elusive explanation of what information is. For the purpose of this experiment lets consider the information as simply the driver for its own transformation, either having the potential - in a static phase - or otherwise being busy effecting the transformation.</p>

                                <p class="p-style">Now, this is a very general definition and not very useful since it basically states that "everything is information, in a state of (potentially) being transformed." So to make it useful people have come up with particular views on what happens in more specific cases. Therefore, we'll take a look next at digital systems, programs and humans and how they interact with each other.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="no example">
                                <h4 class="ui header">The program</h4>
                                <a class="anchor" id="program"></a>

                                <div class="ui container justified" style="padding: 1em;">
                                    <p class="p-style">There are increasingly many types of systems, and even more ways to think about them but here the focus is on digital/programmable systems and the abstract systems of thought that allow humans to interact with them.</p>

                                    <p class="p-style">The process of building such a system involves a human (gifted with natural intelligence), that we usually call a programmer in this context, and who is imagining the system, its intent and the interactions this system has to support to behave as close as possible to its intended function. The way the programmer imagines the system can be in itself quite complex, and even more so as the programmer will shift the point of view depending on the context and the aspects at hand that are being considered. The programmer will have to think of the system first in terms of its externally perceived behavior while at the same time imagining emulating the system's internal behavior and the actions it has to prepare the system to take at a later time when the system will act on behalf of the programmer. These two modes of thinking are of importance to how we program and will come back later to look at it.</p>

                                    <p class="p-style">The simplest form of a digital system is a program. A programmer will first imagine the program during a phase called "design", then create information - the program (the means by which the information is being transformed) during a phase called "implementation" - to get a desired outcome at a later time called "runtime", and then the programmer and others run the program to transform the information as it is at the moment the program starts to new information at the moment the program stops.</p>

                                    <p class="p-style">The details of the outcome are not always clear, but they can be deemed correct or wrong in relation to the program's intention. Lets say a program's outcome is showing on the screen three numbers: 1 2 3. While the programmer might have not expected these exact numbers, any programmer can decide if these are a correct outcome by looking at the program itself and understanding its intention.</p>

                                    <p class="p-style">So, if a program is a collection of information set up to reach a certain goal, where does the information come from ? The information can be either:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>external - originating from user input, or from the environment, and brought in via interfaces: input devices, network, sensors, etc) or</li>

                                        <li>internal information, usually the result of a process that transforms existing information (internal and/or external).</li>
                                    </ul>and the program processes and transforms the input information to obtain the output information which can be can be external(output) or internal (state).

                                    <p class="p-style">The way input information is made available to the system is through various mechanisms:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>contracts / apis (e.g. UIs, external configuration files and registries, command line parameters, etc.), can be public / private.</li>

                                        <li>data - dynamic information with known characteristics but not exactly known values at the time the program is implemented.</li>

                                        <li>the code logic - a representation of the program code is used to apply transformations.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="p-style">But a system can also have multiple programs running simultaneously, which introduces the interesting aspect of multiple programs having to communicate with each other. We'll come back to this later.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="no example">
                                    <h4 class="ui header">The programmer</h4>
                                    <a class="anchor" id="programmer"></a>

                                    <div class="ui container justified" style="padding: 1em;">
                                        <p class="p-style">We name many things. Some exists in the real world, some in our minds alone. When writing programs, part of the job is representing real world information inside a digital system, but the way we do it is not necessarily the way we think about it.</p>

                                        <div class="ui large info message">
                                            <p>For example, if in reality there are many things that are a multiple - almost identical instances - in the digital world we prefer to describe a thing once and then use a number to count the other "would-be" things. We do that to optimize the limitations of the system, with the exception of when we actually allow and encourage the duplication to fight the limitations of the system. Some are artefacts of a past that was more limiting, other of similar concerns that we still cannot overcome at present.</p>
                                        </div>

                                        <p class="p-style">So how is the program being written ?</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">A programmer programs expecting everything will go well, and by that I don't mean that they don't plan for the errors, just that there's an expectation that the process of writing programs will cover all cases the program will run into at a later time. This tends to be a strenuous thing, as the possibilities of something non-trivial going wrong are never too small. But lets contrast this with a different example, that of a human teaching ("programming") another human to do a job on their behalf. The chances are that after the first few iterations the student will still fail significantly when exceptional situations occur, that they were not trained for and when faced with these cases they will either improvise, reach for help, or simply fail. In a lot of cases the "program" of training is a work in progress - incrementally better. However, when it comes to programs, when an exceptional situation occurs they most of the time either stop or end up doing the wrong thing and it is the job of the programmer to find and address these problems.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">And here the first question arises: can the programmer devise better ways to deal with these unexpected cases ? Can we, at the least, construct the program with the awareness that a lot (most!) of things can fail, and learn to deal with the degree by which these fail in a more helpful manner ?
                                        </p>

                                        <div class="ui large info message">
                                            <p>e.g.</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>should an important transaction fail because of a minor formatting issue?
                                                </li>

                                                <li>should anything ever fail because the fancy logger system is not available or should we fallback to a simpler logger?</li>

                                                <li>should the user go through an entire flow to rebuild a transaction simply because by mistake the system temporarily could not a find the right access control ? or once that has been corrected we can notify the user of the new state so they can pick it up from where they have left it previously ?</li>
                                            </ul>

                                        <p class="p-style">In many cases simply thinking about exceptional situations when programming will provide the opportunity for the programmer to find a reasonable fallback.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">In the process of writing the program, the program goes through several phases where it needs to:</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>have its intentions clarified between the programmer and the programs's user (or someone acting on his behalf) about what the program needs to do.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>have a design that satisfies the user's requirements and more, the programmer's own requirements.</li>

                                            <li>be implemented to follow the design.</li>

                                            <li>be verified to be correct.</li>

                                            <li>be provided to the user.</li>

                                            <li>be used.</li>

                                            <li>be maintained.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p class="p-style">In designing a program the programmer will use abstractions. There is always a fine line between too few and too many, between adopting well known patterns and best practices and let the abstractions appear organically (YAGNI). And yes, a lot of times the human factor plays a non-trivial role in moving this fine line around.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">But one of the interesting aspects of the dialog between the programmer and the user is, other than building their own private dialect, the fact that this dialog will in most cases continuously evolve and with every step it will force the abstractions to transform in ways that are much easier comprehended by our minds and expressed through the language and less so expressed through programs. On average, it will take many times over the amount it takes to agree on a design for a non-trivial change that to actually make the change, test it and provide it to the user.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">There are a few reasons for that difference in effort and we'll look at five:</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>the tools available to the programmer are not powerful enough to support the required change easily. Yes, refactoring is getting better but the tools are nowhere close to the versatility of a language operating on the code.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>there's no consistent separation of concerns so the code is still to an extent spaghetti code, either inside the many neat layers, or worse - spaghetti layers. The complexity that comes from layering up abstractions on top of abstraction to the point where complexity comes up from the sheer amount of components and their interactions impacts the programmer understanding and makes for less predictable programs. And not being able to programmatically discover the intent of the code makes evolving it an especially heavy task.</li>

                                            <li>the programs are still written with the expectation that the programmer has a final view of the abstractions or that the program can be changed easily.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>DRY &amp; YAGNI - "Don't Repeat Yourself" should also mean don't repeat the mistakes. If you find yourself repeating not just code, but actively doing things that are tedious without knowing why, the chances are you're RY and YAGNI.</li>

                                            <li>extensibility. It should not be hard.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p class="p-style">Most of the modern software systems still makes the distinction between:</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>designing / implementing,</li>

                                            <li>configuring and</li>

                                            <li>executing a program,</li>
                                        </ul>and as a result there are different environments for these different phases of interacting with a program.

                                        <p class="p-style">This is the first distinction we're looking into, the one between:
                                        </p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>the developer interacting with a IDE versus</li>

                                            <li>other developers interacting with configuration or data tools, or</li>

                                            <li>the end user interacting with the application.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p class="p-style">This distinction is made somewhat unclear by what the process of implementing an application actually is. For most of the programs:
                                        </p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>implementing it means creating flows that define what information to process and how to process it, while</li>

                                            <li>using an application means selecting from those flows and providing some input data to these flows as defined by the developer.</li>
                                        </ul>However, there are many cases where these responsibilities become fluid and the non-developer users are given more power into defining their own flows and logic at runtime.

                                        <p class="p-style">Are the different env warranted? Should other users have access to similar, more consistent environment?</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">Would merging the mediums for design, configuration and runtime phases improve the system? e.g. by allowing moving the responsibilities more easily between various roles?</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">The second distinction we're making is between the system entities available to the developer vs. those available to other users. While developers have access to the facilities provided by their environments, providing similar features to the users of their applications is rarely easy.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="p-style">I've had this questions for a few years now, but more recently I've decided to give it a go and see what comes out of it. Another part that I wanted to understand better the dynamics between types and objects. How do we decide if something is an object or a type ? And not the least, what do these abstractions - types, objects - actually mean.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">I was also curious and wanted to find an explanation for the difference between design, configuration and runtime phases of a program. When and why does something translate into code or something configurable at runtime by the user ? Why isn't it easier to change it afterwards ? How do we decide which business concepts we hard-code and which we don't? Do we have to make that decision? Can we let the power user or end user design the program to a certain extent ? Where does the developer come into the picture ?</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">These are all old, well known questions, and I am hardly the one to make an eloquent point about any of it. Also note that this project doesn't answer these questions. It simply asks them and then goes and explores one tangent.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">What if a program's runtime starts the moment we create it? there are still fences (publish, workspaces, access rights) that prevent access to parts of the program that are not ready for other certain users. As a result the development and deployment of an app doesn't have to be a operation between disconnected worlds.</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">This is where I got so far:</p>

                                        <p class="p-style">In order to be able to manage the program logic the developer has to create for a program subunits of the program. Some of those are:
                                        </p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>functions</li>

                                            <li>classes</li>

                                            <li>modules</li>
                                        </ul>In addition to the each unit's program logic, information has to flow between these units in the process of being transformed.

                                        <p class="p-style">Do we need to make these distinctions? Would any of the following improve the productivity ?</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>a single environment that allows consistent access to program code, configurations and program instances ?</li>

                                            <li>a programming model that allows the developer to:

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>easily allow access to system entities for other users and</li>

                                                    <li>collaborate with other users in developing the program</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>Should a program be built as a static model that mirrors the developer's model ?

                                        <p class="p-style">But as it has been famously said before: "Talk is cheap." Lets see the code.</p>

                                        One of the leading causes of complexity in software systems is that developers sometime uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want.
                                        The hope here is that by extracting the complex business behavior out of the code, this will simplify developers' code.

                                            to find the right abstractions to represent the concepts it needed.
                                            We so far have a sizable list of Italian foods describing the way we build systems:
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>Spaghetti - long strings of logic tortuously touching many other strings, 
                                            occasionally resulting in knots </li>
                                            <li>Lasagna (Layered Monolith) - layers of logic in-between layers of structure 
                                            supporting carbs. Usually a few too many too granular abstractions. 
                                            You can't easily take a layer out.</li>
                                            <li>Ravioli (Microservices) -  smaller components, loosely coupled. 
                                           Not easy to navigate through the code for maintenance purposes.</li>
                                            <li>Pizza (Serverless) - this one comes from simple to any topic you'd like. 
                                            You can mix slices with the right framework, and can buy by slice or make it at home.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        Semantic Types adds a new item to the menu - Broccoli and Meatballs.

                                        Yes, it's .. different. Instead of variety it focuses on structure and strength. 
                                        It keeps the fiber and the meat separate. 
                                        And yes, to get a balanced diet you'll have to combine it with other foods .. 
                                        ok, enough with the food analogy. However, unlike eating a lot of broccoli 
                                        and meatballs using the Semantic Types as a software framework will give the 
                                        basic tools to capture and interact with your data.
